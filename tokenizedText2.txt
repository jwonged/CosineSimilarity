shortly
after

said
his

became
the

to
call

:
``
our

called
on
his

obama

would
be
$

10.6
%
of

2011
,
after
a
lengthy
congressional
debate
over
whether
to
raise
the
nation
's
debt
limit
,
obama
signed
the
bipartisan
budget
control
act
of
2011.
the
legislation
enforces
limits
on
discretionary
spending
until
2021
,
establishes
a
procedure
to
increase
the
debt
limit
,
creates
a

joint

reduction
with

of
achieving
at

savings
over

establishes

if
legislation
originating
with
the
new
joint
select
committee
does
not
achieve
such
savings
.
by
passing
the
legislation
,
congress
was
able
to
prevent
a
u.s.
government
default
on
its
obligations
.
as
it
did
throughout

,
the
unemployment

with

gains
throughout

in

2010
,
the
federal
reserve
noted
that
economic
activity
continued
to
increase
,
but
its
pace
had
slowed
,
and
chairman
ben
bernanke
said
the
economic
outlook
was
``
unusually
uncertain
''
.
overall
,
the

expanded
at
a
rate
of
2.9
%
in

the
congressional
budget
office
and
a
broad
range
of
economists
credit
obama
's
stimulus
plan
for
economic
growth
.
the
cbo
released
a
report
stating
that
the
stimulus
bill
increased
employment
by
1ñ2.1
million
,
while
conceding
that
``
it
is
impossible
to
determine
how
many
of
the
reported
jobs
would
have
existed
in
the
absence
of
the
stimulus
package
.
''
although
an
april
2010
survey
of
members
of
the
national
association
for
business
economics
showed
an
increase
in
job
creation
(
over
a
similar
january
survey
)
for
the
first
time
in
two
years
,
73
%
of
68
respondents
believed
that
the
stimulus
bill
has
had
no
impact
on
employment
.
the
economy
of
the
united
states
has
grown
faster
than
the
other
original
nato
members
by
a
wider
margin
under
president
obama
than
it
has
anytime
since
the
end
of

war
ii
.
the
oecd
credits
the
much
faster
growth
in
the
united
states
to
the
stimulus
in
the
united
states
and
the
austerity
measures
in
the
european
union
.
within
a
month
of
the
2010
midterm
elections
,
obama
announced
a
compromise
deal
with
the
congressional
republican
leadership
that
included
a
temporary
,
two-year
extension
of
the
2001
and
2003
income
tax
rates
,
a
one-year
payroll
tax
reduction
,
continuation
of
unemployment
benefits
,
and
a
new
rate
and
exemption
amount
for
estate
taxes
.
the
compromise
overcame
opposition
from
some
in
both
parties
,
and
the
resulting
$
858
billion
tax
relief
,
unemployment
insurance
reauthorization
,
and
job
creation
act
of
2010
passed
with
bipartisan
majorities
in
both
houses
of
congress
before
obama
signed
it
on
december
17
,
2010.
in
december
2013
,
obama
declared
that
growing
income
inequality
is
a
``
defining
challenge
of
our
time
''
and
called
on
congress
to
bolster
the
safety
net
and
raise
wages
.
this
came
on

heels
of
the
nationwide
strikes

workers

criticism
of
inequality
and

to
pass
legislation
reforming
health
care
in

,
a
key
campaign
promise
and
a
top
legislative
goal

he
proposed
an
expansion
of
health
insurance
coverage
to
cover
the
uninsured
,
to
cap
premium
increases
,
and
to
allow
people
to
retain
their
coverage
when
they
leave
or
change
jobs
.
his
proposal
was
to
spend
$
900
billion
over
10
years
and
include
a
government
insurance
plan
,
also
known
as
the
public
option
,
to
compete
with
the
corporate
insurance
sector
as
a
main
component
to
lowering
costs
and
improving
quality
of
health
care
.
it
would
also
make
it
illegal
for
insurers
to
drop
sick
people
or
deny
them
coverage
for
pre-existing
conditions
,
and
require
every
american
to
carry
health
coverage
.
the
plan
also
includes
medical
spending
cuts
and
taxes
on
insurance
companies
that
offer
expensive
plans
.
on

house
democratic
leaders
introduced
a
1,017-page
plan
for
overhauling
the
u.s.
health
care
system
,
which
obama
wanted
congress
to
approve
by
the
end
of
2009.
after
much
public
debate
during
the
congressional
summer
recess
of

obama
delivered
a

to

session
of

addressed
concerns
over
the
proposals
.
in

a
ban
on
using
federal
funds
for

cell
research
.
on

a

obama
signed
the
bill
into

on

,
2010.
the
aca
includes
health-related
provisions
,
most
of
which
took
effect
in
2014
,
including
expanding
medicaid
eligibility
for
people
making
up
to
133
%
of
the
federal
poverty
level
(
fpl
)
starting
in

,
subsidizing
insurance
premiums
for
people
making
up
to
400
%
of
the
fpl
(
$
88,000
for
family
of
four
in
2010
)
so
their
maximum
``
out-of-pocket
''
payment
for
annual
premiums
will
be
from
2
%
to
9.5
%
of
income
,
providing
incentives
for
businesses
to
provide
health
care
benefits
,
prohibiting
denial
of
coverage
and
denial
of
claims
based
on
pre-existing
conditions
,
establishing
health
insurance
exchanges
,
prohibiting
annual
coverage
caps
,
and
support
for

according
to
white
house
and
congressional
budget
office
figures
,
the
maximum
share
of
income
that
enrollees
would
have
to
pay
would
vary
depending
on
their
income
relative
to
the
federal
poverty
level
.
the
costs
of
these
provisions
are
offset
by
taxes
,
fees
,
and
cost-saving
measures
,
such
as
new
medicare
taxes
for
those
in
high-income
brackets
,
taxes

cuts
to
the
medicare
advantage
program
in

companies
;
there
is
also
a
tax
penalty
for
those
who
do
not
obtain
health
insurance
,
unless
they
are
exempt
due
to
low
income
or
other
reasons
.
in
march

,
the
congressional

estimated
that
the

effect
of
both
laws
will
be
a
reduction
in
the
federal
deficit
by
$
143
billion
over
the
first
decade
.
the
law
faced
several
legal
challenges
,
primarily
based
on
the
argument
that
an
individual
mandate
requiring
americans
to
buy
health
insurance
was
unconstitutional
.
on
june
28
,
2012
,
the
supreme
court
ruled
by
a

vote
in
national
federation
of
independent
business
v.

that
the
mandate
was
constitutional
under
the
u.s.
congress
's
taxing
authority
.
in
burwell
v.
hobby
lobby
the
court
ruled
that
``

for-profit
corporations
could
be
exempt
on
religious
grounds
under
the
religious
freedom
restoration
act
from
regulations
adopted

that
would
have
required
them

that
covered
certain

in

the

came

of

,
which
was
added
by
the
democrats
onto
a
war

passed
by

the

bush
began

term
by
outlining
a
major
initiative
to
reform
social
security
,
which
was
facing
record
deficit
projections
beginning

bush
made
it
the
centerpiece
of
his
domestic

despite
opposition
from
some
in
the
u.s.
congress
.
in
his
2005
state
of
the

,
bush
discussed
the
potential
impending
bankruptcy
of
the

and
outlined
his
new
program
,
which
included
partial
privatization
of

personal

and
options
to
permit
americans
to
divert
a
portion

.
democrats
opposed
the
proposal
to
partially
privatize
the
system
.
bush
embarked
on
a
60-day
national
tour
,
campaigning
for
his
initiative
in
media
events
known
as
``
conversations
on
social

,
in
an
attempt
to
gain
public
support
.
nevertheless
,
public
support
for
the
proposal
declined

decided
not
to
put
social

reform
on

priority
list
for
the
remainder

the
proposal
's
legislative
prospects
were
further
diminished
by
the
political
fallout
from

seeks

that

cited
that

aimed
at
amending
the
clean

act
to
reduce

pollution
through

many
experts
argued
that
this
legislation
would
have
weakened
the
original
legislation
by
allowing
higher
emission
rates
of
pollutants
than
were
previously
legal
.
the
initiative
was
introduced
to
congress
,
but
failed
to
make
it
out

declared

bush
issued
an
executive
order
authorizing
the
president
's
surveillance
program
which
included
allowing

nsa
to
monitor
communications
between
suspected
terrorists
outside
the
u.s
and
parties
within
the
u.s.
without
obtaining
a
warrant
as
required
by
the
foreign
intelligence
surveillance
act
.
as
of
2009
,
the
other
provisions
of
the
program
remained
highly
classified
.
once
the
department
of
justice
office
of
legal
counsel
questioned
its
original
legal
opinion
that
fisa
did
not
apply
in
a
time
of
war
,
the
program
was
subsequently
re-authorized
by
the
president
on
the
basis
that
the
warrant
requirements
of
fisa
were
implicitly
superseded
by
the
subsequent
passage
of
the
authorization
for
use
of
military
force
against
terrorists

the
program
proved
to
be
controversial
,
as
critics
of
the
administration
,
as
well
as
organizations
such
as
the
american
bar
association
,
argued
that
it
was
illegal
.
in
august
2006
,
a
u.s.
district
court
judge
ruled
that
the
nsa
electronic
surveillance
program
was
unconstitutional
,
but
on
july
6
,
2007
,
that
ruling
was
vacated
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
on
the
grounds
that
the
plaintiffs
lacked
standing
.
on
january
17
,
2007
,
attorney
general
alberto
gonzales
informed
u.s.
senate
leaders
that
the
program
would
not
be
reauthorized
by
the
president
,
but
would
be
subjected
to
judicial
oversight
.
later
in
2007
,
the
nsa
launched
a
replacement
for
the
program
,
referred
to
as
prism
,
that
was
subject
to

of

his

have
been
met
with
a
middling
reception
from
art
critics
.
bill
arning
,
director
of
the
contemporary
arts
museum
houston
,
called
his
portraits
``
thickly
painted
in
what
i
would
call
'high-amateur
'
mode
''
and
wrote
,
``
i
would
say
they
need
to
be
less
based
on
photographic
reproduction
.
you
can
tell
when
someone
is
taking

making
a

out

'd
be

''
legacy
george
w.
bush
's
legacy
remains
a
contested
one
.
supporters
credit
bush
's
counterterrorism
policies
with
preventing
another
major
terrorist
attack
from
occurring
in
the
us
after
9/11
and
also
praise
individual
policies
such
as
the
medicare
prescription
drug
benefit
and
the
aids
relief
program
known
as
pepfar
.
critics
often
point
to
his
handling
of
the
iraq
war
,
specifically
the
failure
to
find
weapons
of
mass
destruction
,
that
were
the
main
rationale
behind
the
initial
invasionóas
well
as
his
handling
of
tax
policy
,
hurricane
katrina
and
the
2008
financial
crisis
as
proof
that
george
w.
bush
was
unfit
to
be
president
.
several
historians
and
commentators
hold
the
view
that
bush
was
one
of
the
most
consequential
presidents
in
american
history
.
princeton
university
scholar
julian
zelizer
described
bush
's
presidency
as
a
``
transformative
''
one
,
and
said
that
``
some
people
hate
him
,
some
people
love
him
,
but
i
do
think
he
'll
have
a
much
more
substantive
perception
as
time
goes
on
''
.
bryon
williams
of
the
huffington
post
referred
to
bush
as
``
the
most
noteworthy
president
since
fdr
''
and
said
that
the
patriot
act
``
increased
authority
of
the
executive
branch
at
the
expense
of
judicial
opinions
about
when
searches
and
seizures
are
reasonable
''
as
evidence
.
bush
's
administration
presided
over
the
largest
tax
cuts
since
the
reagan
administration
,
and
his
homeland
security
reforms
proved
to
be
the
most
significant
expansion
of
the
federal
government
since
the
great
society
.
much
of
these
policies
have
endured
in
the
administration
of
bush
's
democratic
successor
,
barack
obama
.
a
2010
siena
research
institute
survey
of
the
opinions
of
historians
,
political
scientists
,
and
presidential
scholars
ranked
him
39th
out
of
43
presidents
.
the
survey
respondents
gave
president
bush
low
ratings
on
his
handling
of
the
u.s.
economy
,
communication
,
ability
to
compromise
,
foreign
policy
accomplishments
,
and
intelligence
.
among
the
public
,
his
reputation
has
improved
somewhat
since
his
presidency
ended
in
2009.
in
february
2012
,
gallup
reported
that
``
americans
still
rate
george
w.
bush
among
the
worst
presidents
,
though
their
views
have
become
more
positive
in
the
three
years
since
he
left
office
.
''
gallup
had
earlier
noted
that
bush
's
favorability
ratings
in
public
opinion
surveys
had
begun
to
rise
a
year
after
he
had
left
office
,
from
40
percent
in
january
2009
and
35
percent
in
march
2009
,
to
45
percent
in
july
2010
,
a
period
during
which
he
had
remained
largely
out
of
the
news
.
other
pollsters
have
noted
similar
trends
of
slight
improvement
in
bush
's
personal
favorability
since
the
end
of
his
presidency
.
in
april
2013
,
bush
's
approval
rating
stood
at
47
percent
approval
and
50
percent
disapproval
in
a
poll
jointly
conducted
for
the
washington
post
and
abc
,
his
highest
approval
rating
since
december
2005.
bush
had
achieved
notable
gains
among
seniors
,
non-college
whites
,
and
moderate
and
conservative
democrats
since
leaving
office
,
although
majorities
disapproved
of
his
handling
of
the
economy
(
53
percent
)
and
the
iraq
war
(
57
percent
)
.
his
47
percent
approval
rating
was
equal
to
that
of
president
obama
's
in
the
same
polling
period
.
a
cnn
poll
conducted
that
same
month
found
that
55
percent
of
americans
said
bush
's
presidency
had
been
a
failure
,
with
opinions
divided
along
party
lines
,
and
43
percent
of
independents
calling
it
a
success
.
